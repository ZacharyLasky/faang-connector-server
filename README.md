# FAANG Connector Server
Connect top tech jobs with top tech candidates!

## UI source code: https://github.com/ZacharyLasky/faang-connector-client

This website uses Google's Puppeteer to scrape job postings and candidates from FAANG company websites and SignalHire.

Candidates are compared to the job listings based on their skills. If they are a good fit, you will see them listed as a match after selecting a job.

The server code is written in Node with Express and the user interface is written in React. The project is hosted on Netlify and Heroku.

New jobs and candidates are automatically scraped every day, once a day.

Candidate contact information is not listed to protect their privacy.
